MATH 491 Independent Study project involving the analysis of classroom usage data at SDSM&amp;T.

## For a minimum level of an assigned grade of a C

1. Complete an analysis of the problem from the spreadsheet data that is given. Provide a percentage of class seats used during every hour of every class day for the following classes
   * M 205, M 304, M 306, M 310, M 313
   * CB 106, CB 107, CB 110, CB 116, CB 118, CB 203, CB 204E, CB 204W, CB 205E, CB 205W, CB 206E, CB 206W, CB 309, CB 327, CB 328, CB 329, CB 330
   * MCBC 113, MCBC 2228 (old number of C 228), CBEC 3304 (old number C 304), CBEC 3305 (old number C 303)
   * EP 208, EP 252, EP 253, EP 254, EP 255
   * MI 220, MI 222, MI 320
2. Reports broken down by semester
  * What rooms have the highest overall percentage of seats used?
  * What rooms have the lowest overall percentage of seats used?
  * Detailed analysis of the big rooms CB 204E, CB 204W, CB 203, EP 252, EP 253, EP 254, CBC 2228 (C 228), MI 222.

## For a minimum level of an assigned grade of a B

1. All the elements of C level work.
2. Devise a way to visualize the percent of seats used in classroom per hour per day. (bar chart, pie chart, color graph, some way you think is easiest to visualize)
3. Devise a way to measure performance of overall classroom seat usage for a semester, i.e., one number that measures the use of the classroom over a semester.

## For a minimum level of an assigned grade of an A for the course.

1. All the elements of B and C work.
2. Develop a prototype to automate the analysis that can take the spreadsheet data and produce some of the basic reports in level C.
3. A presentation of our work to the department.

## Timeline
* September 30 – preliminary progress report on room analysis
* October 21 – preliminary results from room analysis
* November 18 – level C should be completed and most of level B should be completed.
* December 7 – Presentation to department if desired goal it level A. Discussion of results and demonstration of prototype
